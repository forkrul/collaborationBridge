"""Comprehensive example of advanced soft delete features.

This example demonstrates how to use all the enhanced soft delete
functionality implemented based on the soft delete PRD analysis.

Features demonstrated:
- Enhanced soft delete with audit trails
- Bulk operations for performance
- Cascading soft delete operations
- Database health monitoring
- Configuration management
- Advanced service patterns

Run this example to see the production-ready soft delete system in action.
