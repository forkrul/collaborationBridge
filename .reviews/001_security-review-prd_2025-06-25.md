### Process Enhancement Recommendations
1. **Automated Security Testing**: Integrate Bandit and other security tools into CI/CD pipeline
2. **Rate Limiting**: Implement comprehensive rate limiting for all API endpoints
3. **Security Headers**: Add security headers middleware (HSTS, CSP, etc.)
4. **Dependency Scanning**: Set up automated dependency vulnerability scanning
5. **Penetration Testing**: Schedule regular penetration testing for production deployments
