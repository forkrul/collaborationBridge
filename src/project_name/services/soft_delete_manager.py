"""Production-ready soft delete manager for bulk operations and advanced features.

This module provides comprehensive soft delete management capabilities including:
- Bulk soft delete and restore operations
- Hard delete with retention policies
- Advanced query filtering and recovery
- Audit trail management
- Performance-optimized batch operations

The implementation follows PEP 8, PEP 257, and PEP 484 standards for
code quality, documentation, and type safety.
