# 🚀 Migration System Quick Start

**Want to see the Reshaped UI migration system in action? This guide gets you up and running in 3 minutes!**

## 🎯 Just Want to See the Demo?

### Option 1: Full Development Setup (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <repo-url>
cd project

# Install dependencies (using uv - faster than pip)
make install

# Start development server
make dev

# Visit the migration demo
open http://localhost:3000/migration-demo
```

### Option 2: Frontend-Only Setup (Quick Demo)

```bash
# Clone and navigate to frontend
git clone <repo-url>
cd project/frontend

# Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# Start frontend dev server
npm run dev

# Visit the migration demo
open http://localhost:3000/migration-demo
```

## 🧪 Want to Run Tests?

### Run Migration Tests

```bash
cd frontend

# Run all migration tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern=migration

# Run specific component tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern=MigratedButton
npm test -- --testPathPattern=MigratedTextField
```

### Test Status
- ✅ **MigratedButton**: All tests passing
- ✅ **Most Components**: Tests working with minor warnings
- ⚠️ **Some Components**: Minor test issues (non-blocking)

## 🎨 What You'll See in the Demo

### Interactive Migration Demo
- **Live Component Switching**: Toggle between shadcn/ui and Reshaped UI
- **Theme Switching**: Blue, Green, Purple themes
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Full appearance control
- **100% Component Coverage**: All essential UI components

### Available Components
- ✅ Button (with variants, loading states)
- ✅ TextField (with validation, icons)
- ✅ Select (with options, search)
- ✅ Badge (with variants, colors)
- ✅ Modal (with header, footer, actions)
- ✅ Checkbox & CheckboxGroup
- ✅ TextArea (with resize, validation)
- ✅ Progress (with labels, animations)
- ✅ Switch (with labels, states)
- ✅ Table (with sorting, pagination)
- ✅ DropdownMenu (with submenus, sections)
- ✅ Breadcrumbs (with navigation)
- ✅ Pagination (with page controls)
- ✅ FormControl (with labels, validation)

## 🔧 How the Migration System Works

### Zero-Disruption Migration
```tsx
// Before: shadcn/ui (default)
<Button variant="destructive">Delete</Button>

// After: Reshaped UI (opt-in)
<Button useReshaped variant="destructive">Delete</Button>
```

### Gradual Adoption
- **Component-by-Component**: Migrate one component at a time
- **No Breaking Changes**: Existing code continues to work
- **Consistent API**: Same props, same behavior
- **Enhanced Features**: Better accessibility, animations, theming

### Theme System
```tsx
// Global theme switching
const { setTheme, setAppearance } = useMigrationTheme();

setTheme('blue');        // Blue, Green, Purple
setAppearance('dark');   // Light, Dark
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### For Developers
1. **Explore the Demo**: See all components in action
2. **Read the Code**: Check out the migration components
3. **Run Tests**: Verify everything works
4. **Start Migrating**: Use `useReshaped` prop on components

### For Teams
1. **Plan Migration**: Choose components to migrate first
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Use the comprehensive test suite
3. **Deploy Gradually**: Roll out component by component
4. **Monitor**: Use the demo to verify behavior
