"""Enhanced testing strategy for production-ready soft delete functionality.

This module implements comprehensive testing patterns based on the soft delete PRD
standards, including performance testing, reliability testing, and compliance validation.

Testing Categories:
- Unit Tests: Individual component testing
- Integration Tests: Database and service interaction testing  
- Performance Tests: Bulk operation and scalability testing
- Reliability Tests: Error handling and edge case testing
- Compliance Tests: Audit trail and data integrity testing

The implementation follows enterprise testing standards with proper
fixtures, mocking, and comprehensive coverage reporting.
